# Week 5: Hands on Project

## Project: Sentiment Analysis for Twitter

### Overview

In this project, I made a sentiment analysis for Twitter. I used the Kaggle dataset from Sentiment140. The dataset contains 1.6 million tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.
